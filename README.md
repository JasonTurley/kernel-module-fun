# kernel-module-fun
## Motivation
Inspired by Julia Evan's [repo of the same name](https://github.com/jvns/kernel-module-fun) and her
[You can be a kernel hacker!](https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/09/18/you-can-be-a-kernel-hacker/) blog post.

I took an operating systems course in university, where all the assignments were programming kernel modules. Now I am doing them for fun!
